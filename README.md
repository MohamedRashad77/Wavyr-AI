## üìä Overview

Wavyr AI is Your personal Cellular Network Analyzer & Predictor üì∂ 
It is a powerful, interactive web application that helps students, telecom engineers, network administrators, and researchers analyze cellular network performance data and build predictive models. It combines data science and machine learning techniques with an intuitive interface to provide insights into network behavior and predict performance metrics.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and understand your network data with statistical analysis and correlations
- **Model Training**: Build machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data points using your trained models
- **Visualizations**: Generate insightful visualizations including:
  - Signal strength heatmaps
  - Network type performance comparisons
  - Throughput trends over time
  - Feature correlation analysis
  - Distribution analysis
  - Performance metric visualization
